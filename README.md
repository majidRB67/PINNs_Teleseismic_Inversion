# PINNs_Teleseismic_Inversion

For the details of the method please see my published article https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12035 titled Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Wave Propagation and Full Waveform Inversions.


This repo contains the code and the results from Case4 in the manuscript.

The two events files contain the seismograms and the initial snapshots for the training that will be called in the code.

The pickle file recorded_weights.pickle in the result folder contains the weights and biases of a trained PINNs for this problem.
